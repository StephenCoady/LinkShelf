# Advanced Search & Tags

## Overview
Enhance the existing search functionality with powerful filtering options, tagging system, and intelligent search features to make finding bookmarks faster and more intuitive.

## Motivation
Current search is basic text matching, but users need more sophisticated ways to find bookmarks:
- Simple text search often returns too many irrelevant results
- No way to filter by date, category, or other metadata
- Missing bookmarks because titles don't contain exact search terms
- Can't save common searches or create smart collections
- No way to tag bookmarks for cross-category organization

## Proposed Solution

### Enhanced Search Features
1. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by category, shelf, date added, last accessed, tags
2. **Search Operators**: Support for AND, OR, NOT, quotes, wildcards
3. **Saved Searches**: Save frequently used search queries for quick access
4. **Search History**: Recent searches with one-click repeat
5. **Real-time Suggestions**: Autocomplete and search-as-you-type
6. **Fuzzy Matching**: Find bookmarks even with typos or partial matches

### Tagging System
1. **Custom Tags**: Users can add multiple tags to any bookmark
2. **Tag Autocomplete**: Suggest existing tags while typing
3. **Tag Hierarchy**: Support nested tags (e.g., `work/projects/client-a`)
4. **Smart Tags**: Automatically suggested tags based on content analysis
5. **Tag Colors**: Visual coding system for different tag types
6. **Bulk Tagging**: Apply tags to multiple bookmarks at once

### Smart Search Features
1. **Content Search**: Search within cached page content, not just titles
2. **Visual Search**: Find bookmarks by favicon or visual appearance
3. **Semantic Search**: Find related bookmarks even without exact keyword matches
4. **Search Scopes**: Limit search to specific shelves or categories
5. **Natural Language**: "Show me work bookmarks from last week"

### Filter Options
- **Date Ranges**: Last week, month, year, custom ranges
- **Categories**: Single or multiple category selection
- **Shelves**: Search across all shelves or specific ones
- **Tags**: Filter by one or more tags (AND/OR logic)
- **Status**: Broken links, untagged items, duplicates
- **Usage**: Frequently accessed, never accessed, recent additions

### User Interface Improvements
1. **Advanced Search Panel**: Expandable interface with all filter options
2. **Filter Pills**: Visual representation of active filters with easy removal
3. **Search Results Sorting**: By relevance, date, alphabetical, usage frequency
4. **Quick Filters**: One-click common searches (untagged, recent, favorites)
5. **Search Preview**: Show snippet of page content in results

### Saved Searches & Smart Collections
1. **Search Bookmarks**: Save complex searches as virtual bookmarks
2. **Dynamic Collections**: Auto-updating collections based on search criteria
3. **Quick Access**: Pin important searches to sidebar or header
4. **Search Sharing**: Share saved searches between shelves or users

### Technical Implementation
- Extend search indexing to include tags and metadata
- Use full-text search algorithms (stemming, ranking)
- Cache search results for better performance
- Index page content during bookmark creation
- Implement search result highlighting
- Store search preferences in user settings

### Tag Management Interface
1. **Tag Manager**: Dedicated interface for viewing and organizing all tags
2. **Tag Renaming**: Bulk rename tags across all bookmarks
3. **Tag Merging**: Combine similar tags
4. **Tag Statistics**: Show tag usage counts and distribution
5. **Tag Cleanup**: Find and remove unused or duplicate tags

### Search Analytics
- Track search success rates (clicks after search)
- Identify common search patterns
- Suggest tag improvements based on search behavior
- Optimize search algorithm based on user behavior

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `/` - Focus search (already implemented)
- `Ctrl+F` - Advanced search
- `Ctrl+Shift+F` - Search in current category
- `Escape` - Clear search and filters
- Arrow keys - Navigate search results

## Benefits
- **Faster Discovery**: Find bookmarks quickly even in large collections
- **Better Organization**: Tags provide cross-category organization
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Less mental effort to remember exact bookmark names
- **Improved Workflow**: Saved searches and smart collections for repeated tasks
- **Scalability**: Works well even with thousands of bookmarks

## Implementation Priority
**Medium-High** - Significantly improves usability for power users and addresses a common pain point as collections grow larger.
