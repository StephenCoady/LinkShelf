# Bookmark Health Monitor

## Overview
Automatically monitor the health of bookmarks by checking for broken links, detecting duplicates, monitoring site changes, and providing maintenance recommendations.

## Motivation
Over time, bookmark collections become cluttered and outdated:
- Links break when websites go offline or change URLs
- Duplicate bookmarks accumulate across different categories
- Websites change content, making old bookmarks less relevant
- No easy way to identify and clean up problematic bookmarks
- Users waste time clicking on broken or outdated links

## Proposed Solution

### Core Features
1. **Broken Link Detection**: Periodically check if bookmarks return 404, 500, or timeout errors
2. **Duplicate Detection**: Find identical URLs across different categories and shelves
3. **Redirect Tracking**: Detect when URLs redirect and offer to update to final destination
4. **Content Change Monitoring**: Alert when important pages significantly change content
5. **Favicon Updates**: Refresh outdated favicons when sites update their branding
6. **Site Health Scoring**: Give each bookmark a health score based on multiple factors

### Health Checks
- **HTTP Status**: 200 (good), 3xx (redirect), 4xx/5xx (broken), timeout (slow/offline)
- **SSL Certificate**: Valid, expired, or missing HTTPS
- **Page Content**: Title changes, major content changes, page restructuring
- **Performance**: Load time, size changes
- **Accessibility**: Whether the site is accessible from current location

### User Interface
1. **Health Dashboard**: Overview of bookmark collection health with statistics
2. **Problem Alerts**: Notification system for newly detected issues
3. **Batch Actions**: One-click tools to fix common problems
4. **Health Reports**: Regular email/notification summaries of bookmark status
5. **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded health status for each bookmark (green/yellow/red)

### Maintenance Tools
- **Smart Cleanup**: Suggest bookmarks to delete based on age and health
- **Duplicate Merger**: Merge duplicate bookmarks while preserving categorization
- **URL Updater**: Automatically update redirected URLs with user approval
- **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple problematic bookmarks for batch operations

### Technical Implementation
- Background service worker to perform health checks
- Rate limiting to avoid overwhelming servers
- Configurable check frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Store health data with timestamps in Chrome storage
- Use web workers for non-blocking health checks
- Implement exponential backoff for failed checks

### Settings & Configuration
- **Check Frequency**: How often to run health checks
- **Check Types**: Enable/disable specific health check types
- **Notification Preferences**: When and how to alert about problems
- **Auto-Fix Options**: Automatically fix certain types of issues
- **Exclusions**: Skip health checks for specific domains or bookmarks

## Benefits
- **Improved Reliability**: Ensures bookmarks actually work when clicked
- **Time Savings**: Reduces frustration from clicking broken links
- **Collection Hygiene**: Keeps bookmark collections clean and organized
- **Proactive Maintenance**: Catch problems before they become major issues
- **Better User Experience**: Users can trust their bookmark collection

## Implementation Priority
**Medium-High** - Addresses a real pain point that becomes more significant as bookmark collections grow over time.
